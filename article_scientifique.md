# Comparative Clinical and Immunopathological Analysis of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Behçet’s Disease: Implications for Biotherapy Response and AI-Based Clinical Decision Support

## Abstract

**Background:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Behçet’s disease (BD) are chronic inflammatory disorders with distinct immunopathological mechanisms. RA is a prototypical autoimmune disease driven by adaptive immunity with specific autoantibodies (RF, anti-CCP), whereas BD lies at the interface between autoimmunity and autoinflammation, dominated by innate immune hyperactivation without specific biomarkers (Hatemi et al., 2018; Smolen et al., 2023). This study aimed to compare clinical and biological profiles of RA and BD patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of biotherapies in real‑life settings, with implications for data‑driven clinical decision systems.

**Methods:** An observational (retrospective and prospective) monocentric study was conducted at an immunology laboratory in Algiers between January and May 2025. The study included 52 patients with RA (ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria) and 10 patients with ocular Behçet’s disease (uveo‑Behçet). All patients received biotherapy (anti‑TNF, anti‑IL6, or anti‑CD20). Clinical and biological parameters were assessed before and after treatment (6 months for RA, 24 months for BD). Response was evaluated using DAS28/EULAR criteria for RA and reduction of ocular inflammation for BD. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Chi‑square test with standardized residuals, and Tukey’s post‑hoc test (p < 0.05). Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica and Microsoft Excel.

**Results:** Among RA patients, 75% were female (sex ratio 3:1, mean age 51.6 ± 13.9 years); among BD patients, 90% were male (sex ratio 9:1, mean age 36 years). The overall favorable response rate to biotherapy was 71% for RA and 70% for BD. Baseline disease activity (DAS28) was significantly associated with treatment response (p = 0.00448), while no significant associations were observed with age, disease duration, or CRP/ESR levels. ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and REMICAD (infliximab) were significantly associated with good response, whereas MABTHERA (rituximab) showed a moderate response profile. ENBREL and HUMIRA showed no significant association (Nishimoto et al., 2009; van Vollenhoven et al., 2010).

## Introduction

Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by dysregulated immune responses leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypical autoimmune disease driven by adaptive immunity, with well‑established biomarkers such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti‑citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).

In contrast, Behçet’s disease (BD) is a complex inflammatory disorder involving predominant activation of innate immunity and lacking specific diagnostic biomarkers (Hatemi et al., 2018; Emmi et al., 2024). This distinction results in different diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Biotherapies have significantly improved disease outcomes; however, variability in response highlights the need for better understanding of disease mechanisms and patient‑specific factors.

## Methods

A monocentric observational study was conducted including RA and BD patients treated with biotherapy. Clinical and biological data were collected before and after treatment.

Parameters analyzed included:

* Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR)
* Immunological markers (RF, anti‑CCP)
* Disease activity (DAS28 for RA)
* Clinical manifestations

Statistical analysis included ANOVA, Chi‑square tests with standardized residuals, and Tukey’s post‑hoc analysis to identify significant associations. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica and Microsoft Excel.

## Results

### Clinical and Immunological Profiles

RA patients showed a classical autoimmune profile with specific autoantibodies and chronic synovial inflammation. BD patients exhibited heterogeneous systemic manifestations without consistent immunological markers.

### Therapeutic Response

Biotherapy resulted in favorable clinical outcomes in both diseases (~70%). In RA, response was significantly correlated with baseline disease activity (DAS28), suggesting that patients with higher disease activity benefit more from targeted therapies.

### Molecular‑Level Differences

Differential responses were observed between biotherapies:

* **ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and REMICAD (infliximab)** → strong response
* **MABTHERA (rituximab)** → moderate response
* **ENBREL and HUMIRA** → no significant association

These findings suggest that therapeutic efficacy may depend on underlying inflammatory pathways (myeloid vs. lymphoid dominance).

### Diagnostic Limitations

CRP and ESR were elevated in both RA and BD, confirming their non‑specific nature and limited diagnostic value when used in isolation.

### Infectious Risk Screening

Quantiferon‑TB Gold Plus testing was performed in RA patients prior to initiation of biotherapy. Among them, 4 cases were positive and 3 cases were indeterminate. In accordance with the internal clinical protocol, indeterminate results were managed as latent tuberculosis infection, and patients were treated accordingly before or during biotherapy initiation. This approach reflects real‑world clinical decision‑making under uncertainty.

## Discussion

This study highlights fundamental differences between RA and BD in terms of immunopathology and therapeutic response. RA benefits from measurable biomarkers that facilitate diagnosis and monitoring, whereas BD relies heavily on clinical criteria due to the absence of specific markers.

The variability in response to different biotherapies suggests that underlying immune mechanisms significantly influence treatment outcomes. These results support the need for personalized therapeutic approaches based on immunological profiles.

From a data perspective, these findings illustrate a critical limitation for artificial intelligence systems in healthcare. Models relying primarily on quantitative biomarkers such as CRP or ESR may fail to capture disease‑specific context, leading to potential misclassification or suboptimal therapeutic recommendations.

Therefore, integrating clinical reasoning, disease activity scores, and biological data is essential for developing reliable decision‑support systems.

## Limitations, Biases and Perspectives

### Study Limitations

This study is limited by its monocentric design and relatively small sample size, particularly for Behçet’s disease (n=10), which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

An additional limitation concerns the difference in follow‑up duration between the two groups (6 months for RA vs. 24 months for BD). This discrepancy may affect the comparability of treatment response, as longer follow‑up in BD patients could capture delayed or sustained therapeutic effects not observed within the shorter RA evaluation period.

### Potential Biases

* Selection bias due to monocentric recruitment
* Sample size imbalance between RA and BD groups
* Lack of randomization
* Variability in treatment duration between RA and BD

### AI‑Related Clarification

No artificial intelligence model was trained or validated in this study. The discussion regarding AI limitations remains theoretical and is based on the observed statistical properties and clinical interpretation of biomarkers.

### Future Perspectives

Future studies should include:

* Multicentric cohorts with larger sample sizes
* Standardization of follow‑up duration across groups
* Integration of immunophenotyping (e.g., synovial biopsy)
* Longitudinal analysis of treatment response

From a computational perspective, future work should explore multimodal approaches integrating:

* clinical narratives
* structured biological data
* disease activity scores (DAS28)
* physician reasoning

Such approaches may improve the reliability of AI‑based clinical decision‑support systems in complex inflammatory diseases.

## Conclusion

Biotherapies provide substantial clinical benefit in RA and BD, with response rates around 70%. Baseline disease activity and the choice of therapeutic molecule significantly influence outcomes.

These findings support a precision medicine approach combining clinical, biological, and mechanistic data. They also emphasize the importance of integrating contextual clinical reasoning into AI‑based systems to reduce diagnostic and therapeutic errors.
